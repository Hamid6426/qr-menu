# QR MENU

I am creating a QR-menu web app for managing a restaurant.

## User Registration
Only admins can register a new account with their full name, email, and password. Email confirmation is required for registration. After registration, the user will be redirected to a new menu where they can create a new store.

## Store Information
The store will have basic information such as store name, description, address, phone number, email, and website/social media page link(only one link is enough for now).

## User Roles:
The admin can add other users with different roles (manager, cook, waiter) to manage the store. The owner (admin) and manager can manage (CRUD) the menu, but the manager cannot add other users like the admin.

## Customers
The customers are public and can access the menu by scanning the QR code, which will be served instead of a traditional menu.

## Waiter Role
The waiterâ€™s job remains the same. They will go to the customer and confirm the order on their dashboard.

## Order Statuses:

1- Order Received
2- Order Confirmed
3- Cooking in Progress
4- Cooked
5- Order Delivered
6- Order Complete
